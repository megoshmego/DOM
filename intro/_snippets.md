The transcript provided introduces key terms, ideas, and code snippets related to the Document Object Model (DOM) and its manipulation using JavaScript. Here's a distilled version of those concepts along with relevant code snippets.

1. **The Document Object Model (DOM)**: 

```javascript
// No direct code snippet as DOM is a concept and not a single piece of code.
```

2. **DOM Manipulation**:

```javascript
document.getElementById("title").innerHTML = "Hello DOM!";
```

3. **Interactive Web Applications**:

```javascript
// No direct code snippet as this is a broader concept involving multiple coding practices.
```

4. **DOM Methods**:

   - `getElementById()`:

     ```javascript
     var titleElement = document.getElementById("title");
     ```

   - `querySelector()`:

     ```javascript
     var firstParagraph = document.querySelector("p");
     ```

5. **Event-driven Programming**:

```javascript
var btn = document.querySelector("button");
btn.addEventListener("click", function() {
 alert("Button was clicked!");
});
```

6. **HTML Elements & Nodes**:

```javascript
// No direct code snippet as this is a broader concept involving multiple coding practices.
```

7. **Why the DOM exists**:

```javascript
// No direct code snippet as this is more about the rationale behind the DOM's existence.
```  

Remember, the DOM is a vast topic and this is just a start. More complex topics include different types of nodes, more DOM methods, and various events and event handling techniques.
