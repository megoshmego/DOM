This transcript covers the following key concepts in JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation:

1. **Selecting Elements by ID**: It is a common method used when you know the unique identifier (ID) of an HTML element you wish to manipulate. The method `getElementById` is used for this purpose.

```javascript
let element = document.getElementById('myId');
```

2. **Selecting Elements by Tag Name**: If you want to select multiple elements of the same type, you can use `getElementsByTagName`. This method returns an HTMLCollection (which is similar to an array) of all elements of the specified tag name.

```javascript
let images = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
```

3. **HTMLCollection**: An HTMLCollection is a type of object returned by methods like `getElementsByTagName`. It is array-like (meaning you can access its elements using indices), but it is not actually an array, so it does not have array methods like `push`, `pop`, `forEach`, etc.

```javascript
let images = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
console.log(images[0]); // Accessing the first image
console.log(images.length); // Getting the number of images
```

4. **Case Insensitivity in Tag Names**: When using `getElementsByTagName`, the tag name is case insensitive. You can use 'div' or 'DIV' interchangeably.

5. **Manipulating Elements**: Once elements are selected, you can manipulate them. For example, you can change the style of an element, add an event listener to it, etc. However, this manipulation was not discussed in depth in the transcript.

6. **Children of an Element**: An element in the DOM can have child elements. These can be accessed using the `children` property of an element. The transcript mentioned nested 'i' and 'sup' tags inside a paragraph tag.

7. **Selecting Elements by Class Name**: The transcript concluded by mentioning the next topic to be covered - selecting elements by their class name, which uses the `getElementsByClassName` method.
