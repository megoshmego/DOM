Condensed Information:

1. **Document Object Model (DOM)**: An object-oriented interface that represents a web page's structure, enabling JavaScript to interact with all elements, their attributes, and content.

2. **DOM Manipulation**: The process of using JavaScript to alter the DOM, including the document's structure, style, or content. Example: changing the text of an HTML element.

3. **Interactive Web Applications**: Applications that use JavaScript and the DOM to create dynamic user experiences, such as games or forms.

4. **DOM Methods**: Tools for interacting with the DOM. `getElementById()` retrieves an element with a specified id, while `querySelector()` returns the first element matching a specified CSS selector.

5. **Event-driven Programming**: A programming approach where code responds to user events like clicks or key presses.

6. **HTML Elements & Nodes**: The parts of a document in the DOM, organized as "nodes" in a tree structure. Nodes can be elements, attributes, or text, and have relationships such as parent, child, or sibling.

7. **Purpose of the DOM**: The DOM allows programming languages to interact with HTML and CSS, enabling dynamic, interactive web pages.
