This transcript seems to be from a tutorial video about how to modify CSS styling using JavaScript. 

Here are the important concepts and terms discussed:

1. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: The Document Object Model is an API that allows us to interact with the elements of a webpage in a structured, hierarchical way.

2. **style property**: The style property is a JavaScript property that can be used to get, set, and change the inline CSS styles of an HTML element.

3. **querySelector**: This is a method in JavaScript that returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document.

4. **Inline styles**: These are styles that are applied directly on HTML elements using the "style" attribute. 

5. **Specificity**: This refers to the rules used to decide which style will be applied when there's a conflict between multiple CSS rules.

6. **Camel case**: This is a style of writing where we don't use spaces, and each word or abbreviation begins with a capital letter. JavaScript uses camel case for many of its properties.

Here are code snippets for demonstration:

1. Selecting an element and checking its style property:

```javascript
let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
console.log(h1.style); // logs an object with style properties
```

2. Setting an inline style:

```javascript
h1.style.color = "teal"; // changes the color of h1 to teal
```

3. Reading an inline style:

```javascript
console.log(h1.style.color); // logs the color of h1
```

4. Changing multiple inline styles:

```javascript
h1.style.backgroundColor = "yellow";
h1.style.marginLeft = "100px";
```

5. Remember, in JavaScript, CSS property names are written in camelCase:

```javascript
h1.style.backgroundColor = "yellow"; // not background-color
h1.style.marginLeft = "100px"; // not margin-left
```

6. Changing styles on multiple elements:

```javascript
let images = document.querySelectorAll("img"); // select all images
for(let img of images) {
  img.style.width = "200px"; // resize each image
}
```
