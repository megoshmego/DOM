The key terms and ideas mentioned in the transcript are:

1. **Document Object Model (DOM)**: It's a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of the document as a tree, where each node is an object representing a part of the document (an element, attribute, etc.). 

2. **Nodes**: Everything in the DOM is a node. It can be an element, a piece of text, a comment, or even a newline. Each node is an object in the DOM tree.

3. **Elements**: Elements are a specific type of node, which represent an HTML or XML element in the document. Not all nodes are elements, but all elements are nodes.

4. **li.children and li.childNodes**: The `children` property gives you all the element nodes that are children of a node, while the `childNodes` property gives you all child nodes (including text nodes, comment nodes, etc.).

5. **Text Node**: A text node is a specific type of node that represents a text in the document. This could be the text in an element, or even a newline or a space.

6. **Comment Node**: A comment node represents a comment in the document.

7. **console.dir()**: This function is used to display an interactive list of the properties of the specified JavaScript object. 

Here are some simple demonstrations of the concepts:

```javascript
let li = document.querySelector('li')

// Select the first 'li' element

console.dir(li)
// Display the properties of the 'li' element

console.log(li.children)
// Display the children elements of the 'li'

console.log(li.childNodes)
// Display all the child nodes of the 'li'

li.textContent
// Get the text content of the 'li'
```

In the above code snippets, you can see how we can select an element, view its properties and child nodes, and get its text content. It demonstrates how everything in the DOM is a node, and how some nodes are elements.
