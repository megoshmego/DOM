The given transcript discusses an important concept in JavaScript event handling: **event delegation**. Event delegation allows you to handle events for elements that may not exist when the page loads.

Here's a summary of the key terms and concepts discussed:

1. **Event Listeners**: Functions that "listen" for certain actions (like clicks, key presses, mouse movements etc.) on HTML elements and respond accordingly.

2. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: A programming interface for HTML documents. It represents the structure of a document and allows a way to manipulate its content and structure.

3. **Element selection**: This refers to choosing specific elements from the DOM to manipulate or interact with, for example, selecting buttons by their class name.

4. **Event Delegation**: This is a technique in JavaScript where you delegate the responsibility of handling an event to a parent element instead of the target element itself. This is especially useful when you have elements that are added to the DOM after the page has loaded.

Here's a simple example of event delegation using vanilla JavaScript, following the context provided in the transcript:

```javascript
let friendsList = document.querySelector('#friendsList');

friendsList.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    if (event.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
        event.target.parentElement.remove();
    }
});
```

In this example:

- `document.querySelector('#friendsList')` selects the unordered list (UL) element with the id "friendsList".
- `addEventListener('click', function(event) {...})` adds a click event listener to the "friendsList" UL.
- `if (event.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {...}` checks whether the clicked element is a button.
- `event.target.parentElement.remove()` removes the parent of the clicked button (likely an LI item) from the DOM.

The advantage of this method is efficiency. It adds a single event listener to the parent UL instead of adding individual listeners to each button. This method also covers any new buttons added to the DOM after page load.
