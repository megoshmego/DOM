This transcript presents several important concepts:

1. **Adding Event Listeners to DOM Elements**: Event listeners are used to capture specific events like a click, scroll, etc., on a particular DOM element. You can do this using the `addEventListener` method that is built-in and available on every DOM element.

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
let button = document.querySelector('#myButton');
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log('Button was clicked!');
});
```

2. **Event Types**: Different types of events can be passed as a string in the first argument of the `addEventListener` function. Examples include 'click', 'dblclick' (for double click), and 'mouseover' (when the mouse pointer hovers over an element).

Example:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
  console.log('Mouse is over the button!');
});
```

3. **Callback Functions**: The second argument passed to `addEventListener` is the function that should run when the event occurs. This is also called the callback function.

4. **Removing Event Listeners**: Event listeners added using `addEventListener` can be later removed using `removeEventListener`.

5. **Multiple Event Listeners on a Single Element**: `addEventListener` allows adding multiple event listeners on a single DOM element. This means multiple functions can be executed on a single event type.

Here's an example:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log('First function executed!');
});

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log('Second function executed!');
});
```

6. **Differences between Inline HTML Event Handling, Setting Property Manually, and `addEventListener`**: The transcript explains that setting event handlers inline in HTML or manually in JavaScript only allows one event of a certain type to be handled at a time. If another is added, it will overwrite the previous one. `addEventListener`, on the other hand, allows multiple event handlers of the same type on a single element, with each executing in the order they were added.

7. **Event Manipulation**: Examples of DOM manipulation in response to events are given, such as changing the color of the body or an h1 element in response to a button click.

Example:

```javascript
let h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'violet';
  h1.style.color = 'cyan';
});
```

These are the major concepts brought up in this transcript, each with a fundamental role in event handling in JavaScript. They allow for dynamic and interactive behavior on web pages.
