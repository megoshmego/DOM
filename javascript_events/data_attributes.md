The key ideas and concepts mentioned in this transcript are:

1. **DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation**: The speaker mentions adding and removing elements from the webpage, specifically `<li>` elements and `<button>` elements. The DOM is a tree-like representation of the content of a webpage that allows scripts to read and manipulate the page's content, structure, and styles.

2. **Event listeners**: Event listeners are functions that wait for a specific event (like a button click) to occur, then execute some code. The speaker is discussing event listeners in the context of clicking on buttons to remove list items.

3. **Problem of dynamically added elements not having event listeners**: When elements are dynamically added to the DOM, they don't have the event listeners attached that were attached to similar elements when the page loaded. This is because those listeners were added before the new elements existed.

4. **Two solutions to the above problem are discussed**: 
   - Manually adding an event listener each time a new element is created.
   - Using event delegation to make the parent element responsible for events on its children.

5. **Event delegation**: Event delegation is a strategy for handling events efficiently, rather than attaching an event listener to each individual element. Instead, you attach a single event listener to a parent element. This listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match on child elements. This is a much more memory-efficient way of handling events on multiple elements.

Here's a simplified code example of these concepts:

```javascript
// Initial list and button creation
let ul = document.querySelector('ul');
let button = document.createElement('button');
button.innerText = 'Click me!';
ul.appendChild(button);

// Adding event listener to the button
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});

// Dynamically adding a new button
let newButton = document.createElement('button');
newButton.innerText = 'New button';
ul.appendChild(newButton);

// The new button won't alert when clicked because it wasn't there when we added the event listener

// Solution 1: Manually adding event listener when new button is created
newButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('New button clicked!');
});

// Solution 2: Event delegation
ul.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  if (e.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
    alert('Button clicked with event delegation!');
  }
});
```

This code first creates a button and attaches a click event listener to it. It then creates a new button and shows that the new button doesn't have the click event listener. To solve this, it shows two strategies: manually adding the event listener to the new button and using event delegation to make the parent (`ul`) responsible for click events on its children.
