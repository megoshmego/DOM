The transcript is about JavaScript's Event object and handling events. Here are the important terms and concepts, as well as sample code:

1. **Event Object**: An object that gets passed into every event handler function in JavaScript. This object contains details about the specific event that occurred.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
     console.log(event); // event object
   });
   ```

2. **Callback function**: A function passed into another function as an argument. It's used in event handling, where the function is called after an event takes place. The Event object is passed to this function as an argument.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function callback(event) {
     console.log(event.target); // target element that was clicked
   });
   ```

3. **Event.target**: A property of the event object, which refers to the element that triggered the event. This could be a button, a link, a form, or any other HTML element.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
     console.log(event.target); // the HTML element that was clicked
   });
   ```

4. **Event.type**: A property of the event object, which tells what type of event was triggered (like 'click', 'keydown', etc.).

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
     console.log(event.type); // 'click'
   });
   ```

5. **Event.pageX / Event.pageY**: These properties of the event object give the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer when the event was triggered.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
     console.log(event.pageX, event.pageY); // prints X and Y coordinates of the click
   });
   ```

6. **Event.preventDefault()**: A method in the event object that prevents the default action of the element from happening. For example, it can prevent a form from submitting or a link from following the URL.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
     event.preventDefault(); // prevents the form from submitting
     // form handling code here
   });
   ```

7. **Different types of events**: The instructor mentioned a few types of events that can be listened for, such as 'click', 'mousedown', 'mouseup', etc.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('mousedown', (event) => {
     console.log(event.type); // 'mousedown'
   });

   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('mouseup', (event) => {
     console.log(event.type); // 'mouseup'
   });
   ```

These concepts are fundamental to understanding event handling in JavaScript, which is a critical part of interactive web development.
