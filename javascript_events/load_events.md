The given transcript mainly covers three crucial concepts related to JavaScript and web development:

1. **Document Object Model (DOM) Loading**: The presenter explains how the HTML document is parsed by the browser to create the DOM. JavaScript code that interacts with the DOM elements may not work correctly if the DOM is not fully loaded when the script runs.

2. **Adding Event Listeners**: The presenter demonstrates how to add event listeners to HTML elements using JavaScript. This allows a developer to specify code that should be executed when a specific event (like a button click) occurs.

3. **Event Types**: The presenter discusses two types of events - DOMContentLoaded and load. The former is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, but sub-resources like images have not finished loading. The latter is fired when the whole page and all dependent resources have finished loading.

**JavaScript code for the above concepts:**

Here is a simple example code snippet demonstrating these concepts:

```javascript
// Selecting a button element
var btn = document.querySelector('button');

// Adding a click event listener to the button
btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('Clicked!');
});

// Adding a DOMContentLoaded event listener to the document
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');
});

// Adding a load event listener to the window
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    console.log('Fully loaded - including all dependent resources like images');
});
```

This code initially tries to select a button element from the DOM and attach a click event listener to it. This will print 'Clicked!' in the console every time the button is clicked.

Then it adds two event listeners: one to the document for the DOMContentLoaded event, and another to the window for the load event. These will print messages to the console when the respective events occur.

For the code to work as expected, it should be located at the end of the HTML body or wrapped inside a DOMContentLoaded event listener to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before the script tries to interact with it. Otherwise, the button may not be selectable if the script runs before the button element is parsed into the DOM.
