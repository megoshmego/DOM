This transcript explains how to handle events in JavaScript to create interactive web applications. Here's an overview of the concepts and examples of how they can be implemented:

**Key concepts:**

1. **Event handling**: It's the way JavaScript handles user actions, like clicks, key presses, or mouse movements, to execute some code. 

2. **Event types**: There are many event types, such as `click`, `dblclick`, `mouseover`, `scroll`, etc. 

3. **Element selection**: To listen for an event, you first need to specify the DOM element where the event is expected to occur.

4. **Callback functions**: These are functions that are passed into other functions as arguments and are executed when the event occurs.

**Three methods of handling events are discussed:**

1. **Inline HTML event handlers**: These are attributes added directly to HTML elements. For example:

    ```html
    <button onclick="alert('Clicked!')">Click me</button>
    ```

    Here, when the button is clicked, it executes the JavaScript code within the quotes.

2. **Traditional DOM event handlers**: These are similar to inline handlers, but they are defined in JavaScript:

    ```javascript
    var button = document.querySelector('button');
    button.onclick = function() {
        alert('Clicked!');
    };
    ```

    This separates the JavaScript from the HTML, which is generally better for maintainability and organization. However, it only allows one function to be assigned per event type.

3. **Event listeners**: This is the most flexible and recommended way of handling events. Event listeners can listen for multiple events of the same type on the same element:

    ```javascript
    var button = document.querySelector('button');
    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
        alert('Clicked!');
    });
    ```

    `addEventListener` method allows you to add multiple event listeners of the same type to the same element, and it has better cross-browser compatibility.

The instructor advises against using the first two methods for the reasons mentioned above and suggests using the third one for its flexibility and compatibility. 

A code snippet for `addEventListener` would look something like this:

```javascript
// Selecting the button element
const btn = document.querySelector("#teal");

// Defining a callback function to change the body color
function changeBodyColor(color) {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = color;
}

// Adding a 'click' event listener to the button
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  changeBodyColor('teal');
});
```

In the example above, the `changeBodyColor` function is called whenever a 'click' event is fired on the button with the id of "teal", changing the body's background color to teal.
