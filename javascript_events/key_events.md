The transcript is discussing JavaScript key events and how they can be utilized to trigger functions based on user input. The key events discussed are:

1. **keypress**: The 'keypress' event triggers when a key that produces a character value is pressed down. This event is typically used for character inputs in a form or something similar.

2. **keydown**: The 'keydown' event is triggered when a key is pressed down. Unlike 'keypress', this event triggers for all keys, not just character keys.

3. **keyup**: The 'keyup' event is triggered when a key is released. Similar to 'keydown', this event triggers for all keys, not just character keys.

Here is an example of how each event could be used:

```javascript
// Select an input
let input = document.querySelector('input');

// Keydown event
input.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  console.log(`Key down: ${event.key}`);
});

// Keyup event
input.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
  console.log(`Key up: ${event.key}`);
});

// Keypress event
input.addEventListener('keypress', function(event) {
  console.log(`Key press: ${event.key}`);
});
```

In this example, whenever a key is pressed, released, or fully pressed (in the case of 'keypress'), a message will be logged to the console with the name of the key. 

It's important to note that each of these events has different use-cases. For example, if you're building a game and you need to detect when an arrow key is pressed down, you'd use the 'keydown' event. However, if you're building a form and you want to validate input as the user types, you'd likely use the 'keypress' event.
