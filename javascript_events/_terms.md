Here is the condensed information suitable for flashcards:

1. **Adding Event Listeners to DOM Elements**: This involves using the `addEventListener` method available on every DOM element to capture specific events such as clicks or scrolls. For example:
    ```javascript
    let button = document.querySelector('#myButton');
    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
      console.log('Button was clicked!');
    });
    ```

2. **Event Types**: Different events like 'click', 'dblclick' (double click), and 'mouseover' (mouse hover over an element) can be passed to the `addEventListener` function.

3. **Callback Functions**: These are the functions that run when an event occurs and are the second argument to `addEventListener`.

4. **Removing Event Listeners**: Event listeners added with `addEventListener` can be removed using `removeEventListener`.

5. **Multiple Event Listeners**: `addEventListener` allows adding multiple event listeners on a single DOM element, enabling multiple functions to execute on a single event type.

6. **Inline HTML Event Handling vs. `addEventListener`**: Setting event handlers inline in HTML or manually in JavaScript allows only one event of a certain type to be handled at a time. `addEventListener`, however, enables multiple event handlers of the same type on a single element.

7. **Event Manipulation**: This involves changing DOM elements in response to events, such as altering the color of an element upon a button click.

8. **DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation**: This involves adding and removing elements from the webpage. DOM is a tree-like representation of the content of a webpage that allows scripts to read and manipulate the page's content, structure, and styles.

9. **Problem of dynamically added elements not having event listeners**: Event listeners attached to elements when the page loaded don't apply to elements added to the DOM later.

10. **Event Delegation**: A strategy for handling events efficiently by attaching a single event listener to a parent element instead of each individual element. The listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match on child elements, improving memory efficiency.

11. **Dynamically Added Elements**: Elements added to the DOM after page load. They won't have event listeners attached, which were set when the page loaded.

12. **Event handling**: The process of executing code in response to user actions like clicks, key presses, or mouse movements.

13. **Element selection**: Choosing specific elements from the DOM to manipulate or interact with.

14. **Inline HTML event handlers**: Attributes added directly to HTML elements to define event handling in JavaScript.

15. **Traditional DOM event handlers**: Defined in JavaScript and separate from HTML for better maintainability and organization. They only allow one function per event type.

16. **Event listeners**: The most flexible way of handling events, allowing for multiple events of the same type on the same element. 

Example of Event Delegation:

```javascript
let friendsList = document.querySelector('#friendsList');
friendsList.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    if (event.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
        event.target.parentElement.remove();
    }
});
```

In this code:

- `document.querySelector('#friendsList')` selects the unordered list (UL) with the id "friendsList".
- `addEventListener('click', function(event) {...})` adds a click event listener to the "friendsList" UL.
- `if (event.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {...}` checks whether the clicked element is a button.
- `event.target.parentElement.remove()` removes the parent of the clicked button (likely an LI item) from the DOM.


1. **Event Object**: In JavaScript, an object that contains details about a specific event and is passed into every event handler function.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
     console.log(event); // logs the event object
   });
   ```

2. **Callback function**: A function passed as an argument into another function, used in event handling where it's called after an event occurs.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function callback(event) {
     console.log(event.target); // logs the target element
   });
   ```

3. **Event.target**: Refers to the element that triggered the event.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
     console.log(event.target); // logs the clicked HTML element
   });
   ```

4. **Event.type**: Tells what type of event was triggered.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
     console.log(event.type); // logs 'click'
   });
   ```

5. **Event.pageX / Event.pageY**: Give the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer when the event was triggered.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
     console.log(event.pageX, event.pageY); // logs the X and Y coordinates
   });
   ```

6. **Event.preventDefault()**: Prevents the default action of the element, e.g., preventing a form from submitting or a link from following the URL.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
     event.preventDefault(); // stops the form from submitting
     // form handling code here
   });
   ```

7. **Different types of events**: Includes 'click', 'mousedown', 'mouseup', etc.

   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('mousedown', (event) => {
     console.log(event.type); // logs 'mousedown'
   });

   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('mouseup', (event) => {
     console.log(event.type); // logs 'mouseup'
   });
   ```

8. **JavaScript Events**: Refers to user or browser actions that JavaScript can respond to, such as clicking, dragging, scrolling, or loading a page.

9. **Event Listeners**: Methods attached to DOM elements that respond to specified events by executing code.

10. **Preventing Default Actions**: `preventDefault` method stops automatic browser actions, like submitting a form when the submit button is clicked.

11. **HTML forms**: Web components that collect user input and can include various types of input elements.

```html
<form>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Input something">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

12. **Form submission**: Sends form data to a server, by default triggers a page refresh.

13. **JavaScript Event Listener**: A function that waits for a specific event to occur and then runs some code.

14. **JavaScript Form Submission Event**: Triggers when a form is submitted, can be listened to with `addEventListener` and the `"submit"` event.

15. **Single-page applications (SPAs)**: Web apps that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app.

16. **Form action attribute**: Specifies where to send form data when a form is submitted.

17. **JavaScript access to form data**: In a form submission event listener, you can access the form data entered by the user.

18. **DOM Loading**: The process of the browser parsing the HTML document to create
